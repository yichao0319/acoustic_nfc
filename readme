Sound Code Usage:
=======================================================
readme.docx has some info. 

- To generate sending wav files:

swch_send_rcf(seed)

- To run:

1) On machine 2, start the receiver by running the following matlab commands:

% machine2:
r = audiorecorder(Fs,16,1);
recordblocking(r,5);
rcv_packet = getaudiodata(r,'int16');
plot(rcv_packet);
wavwrite(rcv_packet,Fs,'rcv_packet3');

2) On machine 1, run sender using the following matlab commands:

% machine1:
Fs = 44100;
[wav_packet,Fs,nbits] = wavread('sent_packet3');
sound(wav_packet,Fs);

3) after finish, on machine 2, run swch_recv_new() to decode the audio file recorded in step 1 (e.g., rcv_packet3)
